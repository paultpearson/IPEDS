These data came from the 2011-12 in-district tuition and fee variable(CHG1AY3) on the price of attendance question of the IC component.

IF institution does not charge different tuition for in-district students(CHG1AY3) from in-state students(CHG2AY3),the in-district charge would contain the same amount as the in-state (CHG1AY3=CHG2AY3).

If the institution does not vary tuition by in-district,in-state, and out-of-state(CHG3AY3), the tuition and fee amount is stored in all 3 variables (CHG1AY3=CHG2AY3=CHG3AY3).

In-district published tuition and required fees for 2011-12

IN-DISTRICT TUITION - The tuition charged by the institution to those students residing in the locality in which they attend school. This may be a lower rate than in-state tuition if offered by the institution.
TUITION AND REQUIRED FEES - Tuition is the amount of money charged to students for instructional services. Tuition may be charged per term, per course, or per credit.
Required fees are fixed sum charged to students for items not covered by tuition and required of such a large proportion of all students that the student who does NOT pay the charge is an exception. 
UNDERGRADUATE - A student enrolled in a 4- or 5-year bachelor's degree program, an associate's degree program, or a vocational or technical program below the baccalaureate. 
FULL-TIME Undergraduate - A student enrolled for 12 or more semester credits, or 12 or more quarter credits, or 24 or more contact hours a week each term 
FIRST-TIME FIRST-YEAR STUDENT - A student attending any institution for the first time at the undergraduate level. Includes students enrolled in the fall term who attended college for the first time in the prior summer term. Also includes students who entered with advanced standing (college credits earned before graduation from high school).
FIRST-YEAR STUDENT A student who has completed less than the equivalent of 1 full year of undergraduate work; that is, less than 30 semester hours (in a 120-hour degree program) or less than 900 contact hours.

Category descriptions:

1) Degree-granting, graduate with no undergraduate degrees - These institutions offer a Master's degree, Doctor's degree  or a First-professional degree and do not offer a Bachelor's degree or an Associate's degree. 

2) Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above - These institutions offer a Bachelor's degree, Master's degree,Doctor's degree or a First-professional degree.  Also, the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded is greater than 50 percent. 

3) Degree-granting, not primarily baccalaureate or above - These institutions offer a Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, Doctor's degree,or a First-professional degree.  Also, the total number of degrees/certificates at or above the bachelor's level awarded divided by the total number of degrees/certificates awarded must be less than or equal to 50 percent.

4) Degree-granting, Associate's and certificates - Institutions offer an Associate's degree and may offer other postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year; at least one but less-than two academic years; at least two but less-than four academic years. This category also includes institutions that offer a postbaccalaureate certificate, Post-master's certificate or a First-professional certificate and the highest degree offered is an Associate's degree.

5) Nondegree-granting, above the baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, Doctor's or First-professional degrees, but offer either Postbaccaulaureate, Post-master's or First-professional certificates. 

6) Nondegree-granting, sub-baccalaureate - Institutions do not offer Associate's, Bachelor's , Master's, Doctor's, or First-professional degrees, or certificates above the baccalaureate level. They do offer postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year; at least one but less than two academic years; or at least two but less than four academic years.

Technical details for Institutional Category (INSTCAT):

Total degrees and certificates and total bachelor's degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree awarded are derived using data from the Completions component.

Total bachelor's degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree is the sum of: 

Bachelor's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=5,MAJORNUM=1)
Postbaccalaureate certificates (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=6,MAJORNUM=1)
Master's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=7,MAJORNUM=1)
Post-master's certificates (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=8,MAJORNUM=1)
Doctor's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=9,MAJORNUM=1)
First-professional degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=10,MAJORNUM=1)
First-professional certificates (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=11,MAJORNUM=1)

Total degrees and certificates is the sum of Bachelor degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelors degree as defined above added to the following:

Associate's degrees (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=3,MAJORNUM=1)
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least two but less-than four academic years 
   (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=4, MAJORNUM=1).
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of at least one but less-than two academic years
   (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=2,MAJORNUM=1); 
Postsecondary certificates, awards or diplomas of less than one academic year 
    (CTOTALT,AWLEVEL=1,MAJORNUM=1) 

Institutions are classified as Degree-granting (DEGGRANT=1) or Nondegree-granting(DEGGRANT=2) using level of offerings data reported on the Institutional Characteristics component. Degree-granting institutions offer an Associate's (LEVEL3=1),Bachelor's (LEVEL5=1, Master's (LEVEL7=1), Doctoral (LEVEL9=1), or a First-Professional (LEVEL10=1) degree. Any institution that offers only certificates are Nondegree-granting.

Nondegree-granting institutions that offer a postbaccalaureate certificate (LEVEL6=1) or a post-master's certificate (LEVEL8=1) or a First-professional certificate (LEVEL11=1) are classified as Nondegree-granting, above the baccalaureate (INSTCAT=5).

Nondegree-granting institutions that only offer certificates of less-than four academic years are classified as Nondegree-granting, sub-baccalaureate (INSTCAT=6).

Degree-granting institutions whose highest degree granted are Associate's (HDEGOFFR=40) are classified as Degree-granting, Associate's and certificates (INSTCAT=4). (There are a few 4-year institutions that grant Postbaccalaureate or Post-master's or First-professional certificates in this category).

Degree-granting institutions that do not grant a Bachelor's degree (LEVEL5=0) and do not grant an Associate's degree (LEVEL3=0) are classified as Degree-granting, graduate with no undergraduate degrees (INSTCAT=1).

The remaining degree-granting institutions offer a bachelor's degree or an associate's degree, or both.
For these institutions a percent of bachelor's degrees and all other degrees/certificates above the bachelor's degree of  total degrees and certificates is generated. If the percent is greater than 50, institutions are classified as Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above (INSTCAT=2), If the percent is 50 or less, institutions are classified as Degree-granting, not primarily baccalaureate or above (INSTCAT=3).

Inactive institutions (CYACTIVE in (2,3)) and administrative units (Sector=0) were coded as not applicable. All Non-Title IV institutions that did not respond to the  IC or Completions components were coded as not reported. 
Degree-granting institutions whose completions data are reported with their parent institution were assigned the same code as the parent institution.
New degree-granting institutions that report offering a bachelor's degree on the current institutional characteristics file for the upcoming academic year, and have not yet reported bachelor's degrees on the current completions that covers the previous academic year  June 1-July 30 were assigned as follows:

If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above (indicating the level was offered) and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above. If an institution reported a zero in any program (CIP code) at any level below the bachelor's degree and did not report a zero for any program (CIP code) for bachelor's degrees or above, the institution was classified as Degree-granting, not primarily baccalaureate or above.

For institutions that reported zeros for bachelor's degrees of above and for levels below the bachelor's, the maximum number of programs by level was used to determine the primary classification. </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Disc</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>15210</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived - IPEDS, Fall 2012, IC and Completion components</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Institutional Characteristics</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Institutional Characteristics</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>HD2012</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;' ><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Code Value</td><td>&nbsp;Value Label</td><td>&nbsp;Frequency</td><td>&nbsp;Percentage</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;2</td><td>&nbsp;Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above</td><td>&nbsp;380</td><td>&nbsp;100.00</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>CCBASIC - Carnegie Classification 2010: Basic</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>Carnegie Classification 2010 Update:  Basic Classification

To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2010 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005. They are as follows: Basic Classification (the traditional Carnegie Classification Framework), Undergraduate and Graduate Instructional Program classifications, Enrollment Profile and Undergraduate Profile classifications, and Size & Setting classification. These classifications provide different lenses through which to view U.S. colleges and universities, offering researchers greater analytic flexibility. 

These classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2008 to 2010. and collectively they depict the most current landscape of U.S. colleges and universities.   Institutions might be classified differently using a different timeframe. Individual classifications are not updated with more recent data.

***Note- Carnegie classifications for IPEDS years 2005-2009,  are the 2005 classifications, which were based on time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2003 to 2005.

The Basic Classification is an update of the traditional classification framework developed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in 1970 to support its research program, and later published in 1973 for use by other researchers. Although this classification has undergone many changes over the years, the current release involves some significant changes from previous editions.

These classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2008 to 2010. and collectively they depict the most current landscape of U.S. colleges and universities.   Institutions might be classified differently using a different timeframe. Individual classifications are not updated with more recent data.

***Note--Carnegie classifications for IPEDS years 2005-2009,  are the 2005 classifications, which were based on time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2003 to 2005.

The instructional program classification is based on three pieces of information: the level of undergraduate degrees awarded (associate’s or bachelor’s), the proportion of bachelor’s degree majors in the arts and sciences and in professional fields, and the extent to which an institution awards graduate degrees in the same fields in which it awards undergraduate degrees.

The distinction between arts and sciences and professional undergraduate majors is one that has been made in the Classification since 1987 (but only for undergraduate colleges), and researchers and others in the higher education community have also made similar distinctions. We are extending and elaborating the previous analysis by (1) applying it to almost all baccalaureate-level institutions, (2) making finer distinctions along the arts & sciences – professions continuum, and (3) recognizing a “middle ground” where the two domains exist in relative balance with respect to graduating students’ major concentrations. 

A high concentration of majors in the arts and sciences is not the same as a liberal arts education, and we do not view any particular location on this continuum as the special province of liberal education. Examples of high-quality liberal education exist across the spectrum.

Some institutions enroll no graduate students. Others may have graduate programs that operate relatively independently of the undergraduate program (such as a law school). Still others offer graduate education in most or all fields where they have undergraduate programs. And of course, some institutions fall between these extremes. By examining the number of undergraduate fields in which we also see graduate degrees, we can locate institutions along this continuum of undergraduate-graduate “coexistence.” Departments that teach only undergraduates can differ in many ways from those that also train graduate students. Examples of such differences include faculty activities and instructional resources.

It is important to emphasize that we do not view these continua (arts & sciences – professions or graduate coexistence) as signifying gradations in value or quality.
The categories are as follows:

Assoc: Associate’s. According to the degree data, these institutions awarded associate’s degrees but no bachelor’s degrees.

Assoc-Dom: Associate’s Dominant. These institutions awarded both associate’s and bachelor’s degrees, but the majority of degrees awarded were at the associate’s level.

A&S-F/NGC: Arts & sciences focus, no graduate coexistence. According to the degree data, at least 80 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

A&S-F/SGC: Arts & sciences focus, some graduate coexistence. At least 80 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in some of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors (but less than half).

A&S-F/HGC: Arts & sciences focus, high graduate coexistence. At least 80 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

A&S+Prof/NGC: Arts & sciences plus professions, no graduate coexistence. According to the degree data, 60–79 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

A&S+Prof/SGC: Arts & sciences plus professions, some graduate coexistence. 60–79 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in some of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors (but less than half).

A&S+Prof/HGC: Arts & sciences plus professions, high graduate coexistence. 60–79 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in the arts and sciences, and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

Bal/NGC: Balanced arts & sciences/professions, no graduate coexistence. According to the degree data, bachelor’s degree majors were relatively balanced between arts and sciences and professional fields (41–59 percent in each), and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

Bal/SGC: Balanced arts & sciences/professions, some graduate coexistence. Bachelor’s degree majors were relatively balanced between arts and sciences and professional fields (41–59 percent in each), and graduate degrees were observed in some of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors (but less than half).

Bal/HGC: Balanced arts & sciences/professions, high graduate coexistence. Bachelor’s degree majors were relatively balanced between arts and sciences and professional fields (41–59 percent in each), and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

Prof+A&S/NGC: Professions plus arts & sciences, no graduate coexistence. According to the degree data, 60–79 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in professional fields (such as business, education, engineering, health, and social work), and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

Prof+A&S/SGC: Professions plus arts & sciences, some graduate coexistence. 60–79 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in professional fields, and graduate degrees were observed in some of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors (but less than half).

Prof+A&S/HGC: Professions plus arts & sciences, high graduate coexistence. 60–79 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in professional fields, and graduate degrees were observed in at least half of the fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

Prof-F/NGC: Professions focus, no graduate coexistence. According to the degree data, at least 80 percent of bachelor’s degree majors were in professional fields (such as business, education, engineering, health, and social work), and no graduate degrees were awarded in fields corresponding to undergraduate majors.

Graduate Instructional Program Description

As a companion to the Undergraduate Instructional Program classification, this classification examines the nature of graduate education, with a special focus on the mix of graduate programs. In this classification, a single graduate-level degree qualifies an institution for inclusion.

The classification is based on the level of graduate degrees awarded (master’s/professional or doctoral), the number of fields represented by the degrees awarded, and the mix or concentration of degrees by broad disciplinary domain. The classification has two parts: one for institutions that do not award the doctorate, and one for doctoral-level institutions (based on the record of degree conferrals, not program offerings). Within each group, we then classify institutions with respect to the breadth of graduate offerings and the concentration of degrees in certain fields or combinations of fields.

For two categories of doctorate-granting institutions, we distinguish institutions offering medical education (defined as human or veterinary medical education, including allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine). Institutions in other categories may also offer medical education, but the numbers were not large enough to justify subcategories and we judged it preferable to differentiate with respect to the other graduate fields, rather than with respect to the presence or absence of medical education.

NOTE: Because a single doctoral-level degree (as defined in the IPEDS data collection of the National Center for Education Statistics) qualifies an institution for inclusion in the doctoral categories, a small number of institutions with large master’s or professional programs and modest doctoral-level programs are currently classified according to their doctoral programs.

The categories are listed below. The term “comprehensive” is used here to denote comprehensiveness of offerings across a range of fields. This is a different usage from that in previous editions of the Carnegie Classification.

S-Postbac/Ed: Single Postbaccalaureate (education). Based on the degree data, these institutions award master’s degrees in education but not in other fields.
S-Postbac/Bus: Single Postbaccalaureate (business). Based on the degree data, these institutions award master’s degrees in business but not in other fields.
S-Postbac/Other: Single Postbaccalaureate (other field). Based on the degree data, these institutions award master’s or professional degrees in a single field other than education or business.
Postbac-Comp: Postbaccalaureate comprehensive. According to the degree data, these institutions award master’s degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM* fields, and degrees in one or more professional fields.
Postbac-A&S: Postbaccalaureate, arts & sciences dominant. These institutions award master’s degrees in some arts and sciences fields. They may also award master’s or professional degrees in other fields, but in lesser numbers.
Postbac-A&S/Ed: Postbaccalaureate with arts & sciences (education dominant). These institutions award master’s degrees in some arts and sciences fields as well as degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in education.
Postbac-A&S/Bus: Postbaccalaureate with arts & sciences (business dominant). These institutions award master’s degrees in some arts and sciences fields as well as degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in business.
Postbac-A&S/Other: Postbaccalaureate with arts & sciences (other dominant fields). These institutions award master’s degrees in some arts and sciences fields as well as degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in a professional field other than business or education.
Postbac-Prof/Ed: Postbaccalaureate professional (education dominant). According to the degree data, these institutions award master’s or professional degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in education.
Postbac-Prof/Bus: Postbaccalaureate professional (business dominant). According to the degree data, these institutions award master’s or professional degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in business.
Postbac-Prof/Other: Postbaccalaureate professional (other dominant fields). According to the degree data, these institutions award master’s or professional degrees in professional fields, and the plurality of graduate degrees are in a field other than business or education.
S-Doc/Ed: Single doctoral (education). Based on the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in education but do not offer other graduate/professional education.
S-Doc/Other: Single doctoral (other field). Based on the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in a single field other than education.
CompDoc/MedVet: Comprehensive doctoral with medical/veterinary. According to the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM* fields, and they also award degrees in medicine, dentistry, and/or veterinary medicine. They also offer professional education in other health professions or in fields such as business, education, engineering, law, public policy, or social work.
CompDoc/NMedVet: Comprehensive doctoral (no medical/veterinary). According to the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM* fields. They also offer professional education in fields such as business, education, engineering, law, public policy, social work, or health professions other than medicine, dentistry, or veterinary medicine.
Doc/HSS: Doctoral, humanities/social sciences dominant. According to the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in a range of fields, with the plurality in the humanities or social sciences. They may also offer professional education at the doctoral level or in fields such as law or medicine.
Doc/STEM: Doctoral, STEM dominant. According to the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in a range of fields, with the plurality in the STEM* fields. They may also offer professional education at the doctoral level or in fields such as law or medicine.
Doc/Prof: Doctoral, professions dominant. According to the degree data, these institutions award doctoral degrees in a range of fields, with the plurality in the professions other than engineering (such as education, health professions, public policy, or social work). They may also offer professional education in law or medicine.

* STEM: Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2010 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005. They are as follows: Basic Classification (the traditional Carnegie Classification Framework), Undergraduate and Graduate Instructional Program classifications, Enrollment Profile and Undergraduate Profile classifications, and Size & Setting classification. These classifications provide different lenses through which to view U.S. colleges and universities, offering researchers greater analytic flexibility. 

These classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2008 to 2010. and collectively they depict the most current landscape of U.S. colleges and universities.   Institutions might be classified differently using a different timeframe. Individual classifications are not updated with more recent data.

***Note--Carnegie classifications for IPEDS years 2005-2009,  are the 2005 classifications, which were based on time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2003 to 2005.

This new classification describes the undergraduate population with respect to three characteristics: the proportion who attend part- or full-time; achievement characteristics of first-year students; and the proportion of entering students who transfer in from another institution. Each of these captures important differences in the nature of the undergraduate population. They do not imply differences in the quality of undergraduate education, but they have implications for how an institution serves its students.

PT2: Higher part-time two-year. Fall enrollment data show at least 60 percent of undergraduates enrolled part-time at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

Mix2: Mixed part/full-time two-year. Fall enrollment data show 40–59 percent of undergraduates enrolled part-time at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

MFT2: Medium full-time two-year. Fall enrollment data show 10–39 percent of undergraduates enrolled part-time at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

FT2: Higher full-time two-year. Fall enrollment data show less than 10 percent of undergraduates enrolled part-time at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

PT4: Higher part-time four-year. Fall enrollment data show at least 40 percent of undergraduates enrolled part-time at these bachelor’s degree granting institutions.

MFT4/I: Medium full-time four-year, inclusive. Fall enrollment data show 60–79 percent of undergraduates enrolled full-time at these bachelor’s degree granting institutions. These institutions either did not report test score data or the scores indicate that they extend educational opportunity to a wide range of students with respect to academic preparation and achievement.

MFT4/S/LTI: Medium full-time four-year, selective, lower transfer-in. Fall enrollment data show 60–79 percent of undergraduates enrolled full-time at these bachelor’s degree granting institutions. Score data for first-year students indicate that these institutions are selective in admissions (our analysis of first-year students’ test scores places most of these institutions in roughly the middle two-fifths of baccalaureate institutions). Fewer than 20 percent of entering undergraduates are transfer students.

MFT4/S/HTI: Medium full-time four-year, selective, higher transfer-in. Fall enrollment data show 60–79 percent of undergraduates enrolled full-time at these bachelor’s degree granting institutions. Score data for first-year students indicate that these institutions are selective in admissions (our analysis of first-year students’ test scores places most of these institutions in roughly the middle two-fifths of baccalaureate institutions). At least 20 percent of entering undergraduates are transfer students.

FT4/I: Full-time four-year, inclusive. Fall enrollment data show at least 80 percent of undergraduates enrolled full-time at these bachelor’s degree granting institutions. These institutions either did not report test score data or the scores indicate that they extend educational opportunity to a wide range of students with respect to academic preparation and achievement.

***Note--Carnegie classifications for IPEDS years 2005-2009,  are the 2005 classifications, which were based on time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2003 to 2005.

By grouping institutions according to the mix of students enrolled at the undergraduate and graduate/professional levels, this classification provides a bird’s eye view of the student population. Exclusively undergraduate institutions are further broken down by level (two-year and four-year). For institutions with both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, institutions are grouped according to the distribution of full-time equivalent students across the two levels, giving an approximate measure of the student population’s “center of gravity.” As a result, it reflects important differences with respect to educational mission as well as institutional climate and culture—differences that can have implications for infrastructure, services, and resource allocation.

The categories are as follows:

ExU2: Exclusively undergraduate two-year. Fall enrollment data show only undergraduates enrolled, and at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

ExU4: Exclusively undergraduate four-year. Fall enrollment data show only undergraduates enrolled, at these bachelor’s granting institutions.

VHU: Very high undergraduate. Fall enrollment data show both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, with the latter group accounting for less than 10 percent of FTE* enrollment.

HU: High undergraduate. Fall enrollment data show both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, with the latter group accounting for at least 10–24 percent of FTE enrollment.

MU: Majority undergraduate. Fall enrollment data show both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, with the latter group accounting for 25–49 percent of FTE enrollment.

MGP: Majority graduate/professional. Fall enrollment data show both undergraduate and graduate/professional students, with the latter group accounting for at least half of FTE enrollment.

ExGP: Exclusively graduate/professional. Fall enrollment data show only graduate/professional students enrolled.

* FTE: Full-time equivalent enrollment was calculated as full-time plus one-third part-time.

***Note--Carnegie classifications for IPEDS years 2005-2009,  are the 2005 classifications, which were based on time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2003 to 2005.

This classification describes institutions’ size and residential character. Because residential character applies to the undergraduate student body, exclusively graduate/professional institutions are not included. 

Size matters. It is related to institutional structure, complexity, culture, finances, and other factors. Indeed, it is probably the most influential omitted variable in the 1970 classification framework. Residential or nonresidential character reflects aspects of the campus environment, student population served, and the mix of programs and services that an institution provides.

Four-year institutions are divided into four categories of full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment and three categories of residential character. Neither characteristic implies differences in the quality of undergraduate education, but an institution’s location along the two continua generally corresponds to a distinctive mix of educational challenges and opportunities. Because few two-year institutions serve a residential population, these institutions are classified solely based on FTE enrollment.

The residential character measure is based on two attributes: the proportion of degree-seeking undergraduates who attend full-time and the proportion living in institutionally-owned, -operated, or -affiliated housing. It is important to note the variety of situations of students who do not live in college or university housing. Some are true “commuting” students, while others may live with other students in rental housing on the periphery of campus, and still others are distance education students who rarely or never set foot on a campus.

The categories are as follows:

VS2: Very small two-year. Fall enrollment data show FTE* enrollment of fewer than 500 students at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

S2: Small two-year. Fall enrollment data show FTE enrollment of 500–1,999 students at these associate’s degree granting institutions.

A land-grant college or university is an institution that has been designated by its state legislature or Congress to receive the benefits of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. The original mission of these institutions, as set forth in the first Morrill Act, was to teach agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies so that members of the working classes could obtain a liberal, practical education. 

Over the years, land-grant status has implied several types of federal support. The first Morrill Act provided grants in the form of federal lands to each state for the establishment of a public institution to fulfill the act's provisions. At different times money was appropriated through legislation such as the second Morrill Act and the Bankhead-Jones Act, although the funding provisions of these acts are no longer in effect. Today, the Nelson Amendment to the Morrill Act provides a permanent annual appropriation of $50,000 per state and territory. 

A key component of the land-grant system is the agricultural experiment station program created by the Hatch Act of 1887. The Hatch Act authorized direct payment of federal grant funds to each state to establish an agricultural experiment station in connection with the land-grant institution there. The amount of this appropriation varies from year to year and is determined for each state through a formula based on the number of small farmers there. A major portion of the federal funds must be matched by the state. 

To disseminate information gleaned from the experiment stations' research, the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created a Cooperative Extension Service associated with each U.S. land-grant institution. This act authorized ongoing federal support for extension services, using a formula similar to the Hatch Act's to determine the amount of the appropriation. This act also requires that the states provide matching funds in order to receive the federal monies.


Passage of the First Morrill Act (1862) reflected a growing demand for agricultural and technical education in the United States. While a number of institutions had begun to expand upon the traditional classical curriculum, higher education was still widely unavailable to many agricultural and industrial workers. The Morrill Act was intended to provide a broad segment of the population with a practical education that had direct relevance to their daily lives.

The Second Morrill Act (1890) sought to extend access to higher education by providing additional endowments for all land-grants, but prohibiting distribution of money to states that made distinctions of race in admissions. However, states that provided a separate land-grant institution for blacks were eligible to receive the funds. The institutions that, as a result of this act, were founded or designated the land-grant for blacks in each of the then-segregated Southern states came to be known as "the 1890 land-grants."  Native American tribal colleges are sometimes called the "1994 land-grants."

This variable is derived from the enrollment by race/ethnicity section of the fall enrollment survey. The full-time equivalent of the institution's part-time enrollment is estimated and then added to the full-time enrollment of the institution. This formula has been used to produce the full-time equivalent enrollment that is published annually in the Digest of Education Statistics. The full-time equivalent of part-time enrollment is estimated by multiplying the part-time enrollment by factors that vary by control and level of institution and level of student. The following factors were used:

Part-time undergraduate enrollment (line 22) 
Public 4-year .403543
Not-for-profit and for-profit, 4-year .392857
Public 2-year and <2year .335737
All other sectors .397058

Graduate (line 25)
Public 4-year .361702
Not-for-profit and for-profit, 4-year .382059

First-time student (undergraduate degree/certificate seeking)  A student who has no prior postsecondary experience (except as noted below) attending any institution for the first time at the undergraduate level. This includes students enrolled in academic or occupational programs. It also includes students enrolled in the fall term who attended college for the first time in the prior summer term, and students who entered with advanced standing (college credits earned before graduation from high school). Student is enrolled in courses for credit and recognized by the institution as seeking a degree, certificate, or other formal award. High school students also enrolled in postsecondary courses for credit are not considered degree/certificate-seeking. 
 
State of residence - the state identified by the student as his/her permanent address at the time of application to the institution. This may be the legal residence of a parent or guardian, or the state in which a student has a driver's license or is registered to vote. It is not necessarily the state in which the student's high school is located. </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Cont</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>24927</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived - IPEDS, Spring 2013, Fall Enrollment component</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Frequently used enrollment variables: Fall 2012</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Frequently used enrollment variables: Fall 2012</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>DRVEF_RM2012</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Maximum</td><td>&nbsp;Minimum</td><td>&nbsp;Mean</td><td>&nbsp;Standard deviation</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;83</td><td>&nbsp;0</td><td>&nbsp;1</td><td>&nbsp;5.46</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>PCTDEEXC - Percent of students enrolled exclusively in distance education courses</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>Percent of students who are enrolled only in courses that are considered distance education courses.

The full-time-equivalent (FTE) enrollment used in this report is the sum of the institutions’ FTE undergraduate enrollment and FTE graduate enrollment (as calculated from or reported on the 2011-12 12-month Enrollment component) plus the estimated FTE of first-professional students. Undergraduate and graduate FTE are estimated using 12-month instructional activity (credit and/or contact hours). First-professional FTE is estimated by calculating the ratio of full-time to part-time first-professional students from the Fall 2008 counts and applying this ratio to the 2011-12 12-month unduplicated headcount of first-professional students. The estimated number of full-time students is added to one-third of the estimated number of part-time students.

The calculation of FTE undergraduate and graduates is as follows:
Quarter calendar system 
Enrollment level (One FTE over 12-month period) 
Undergraduate 45 credit hours, 900 contact hours 
Graduate 36 credit hours
Semester/trimester/4-1-4 plan/other calendar system 
Enrollment level (one FTE over 12-month period) 
Undergraduate 30 credit hours 900 contact hours 
Graduate 24 credit hours
For institutions with continuous enrollment programs, FTE is determined by dividing the number of contact hours attempted by 900. </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Cont</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>23365</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived DFR - IPEDS, Fall 2012, 12 Enrollment (E12) component</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Frequently used enrollment variables: 2011-12</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Frequently used enrollment variables: 2011-12</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>DRVEF122012</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Maximum</td><td>&nbsp;Minimum</td><td>&nbsp;Mean</td><td>&nbsp;Standard deviation</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;81074</td><td>&nbsp;2</td><td>&nbsp;5789</td><td>&nbsp;10531.74</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>ASCDEG - Associate's degree</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>Associate's degree awarded between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012

Bachelor's degree - An award (baccalaureate or equivalent degree, as determined by the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education) that normally requires at least 4 but not more than 5 years of full-time equivalent college-level work. This includes all bachelor's degrees conferred in a 5-year cooperative (work-study) program. A cooperative plan provides for alternate class attendance and employment in business, industry, or government; thus, it allows students to combine actual work experience with their college studies.

Graduation rate of first-time, full-time degree or certificate-seeking students  - 2006 cohort (4-year institutions) and 2009 cohort (less-than-4-year institutions). 
The graduation rate is the rate  required for disclosure and/or reporting purposes under Student Right-to-Know. This rate is calculated as the total number of completers within 150% of normal time divided by the revised cohort minus any allowable exclusions. 
For 4-year institutions the adjusted cohort is defined by the variable GRTOTLT when GRTYPE=2 and the total completers within 150% of normal time is GRTOTLT when GRTYPE=3. GRTYPE=2 and 3 include both the bachelor's or equivalent degree/certificate-seeking subcohort and the other degree/certificate-seeking subcohort (Table gr2012).

For 2-year institutions the adjusted cohort is defined by the variable GRTOTLT when GRTYPE=29 and the total completers within 150% of normal time is GRTOTLT when GRTYPE=30 (Table gr2011).

For less-than-2-year institutions the adjusted cohort defined by the variable LINE_50 and the total completers within 150% of normal time is LINE_11 (Table gr2011_L2)

Normal time to completion -  The amount of time necessary for a student to complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the institution's catalog.

Local appropriations, education district taxes, and similar support - Local appropriations are government appropriations made by a governmental entity below the state level. Education district taxes include all tax revenues assessed directly by an institution or on behalf of an institution when the institution will receive the exact amount collected. These revenues also include similar revenues that result from actions of local governments or citizens (such as through a referendum) that result in receipt by the institution of revenues based on collections of other taxes or resources (sales taxes, gambling taxes, etc.). </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Cont</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>66110</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived DFR - IPEDS, Spring 2013, Finance component</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Frequently used financial indicators for all institutions: Fiscal year 2012</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Frequently used financial indicators for all institutions: Fiscal year 2012</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>DRVF2012</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Maximum</td><td>&nbsp;Minimum</td><td>&nbsp;Mean</td><td>&nbsp;Standard deviation</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;1</td><td>&nbsp;0</td><td>&nbsp;0</td><td>&nbsp;0.11</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>F1GVGCPC - Government grants and contracts as a percent of core revenues (GASB)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>Government grants and contracts as a percent of core revenues for public institutions using GASB 34/35 standards is derived as follows:

Government grants and contract revenues is then divided by total core revenues (F1CORREV)

Government grants and contracts (revenues) - Revenues from governmental agencies that are for specific research projects, other types of programs , or for general institutional operations (if not government appropriations). Examples are research projects, training programs, student financial assistance, and similar activities for which amounts are received or expenses are reimbursable under the terms of a grant or contract, including amounts to cover both direct and indirect expenses. Includes Pell Grants and reimbursement for costs of administering federal financial aid programs. Grants and contracts should be classified to identify the governmental level - federal, state, or local - funding the grant or contract to the institution; grants and contracts from other sources are classified as nongovernmental grants and contracts. GASB institutions are required to classify in financial reports such grants and contracts as either operating or nonoperating.  

Operating - GASB requires that revenues and expenses be separated between operating and nonoperating. Operating revenues and expenses result from providing goods and services. Operating transactions are incurred in the course of the operating activities of the institution 

Nonoperating - GASB requires that revenues and expenses be separated between operating and nonoperating. Operating revenues and expenses result from providing goods and services. Nonoperating activities are those outside the activities that are part of the operating activities of the institution. Most government appropriations are nonoperating because they are not generated by the operations of the institution. Investment income is nonoperating in most instances because institutions are not engaged in investing as an operating activity. Gifts are defined as nonoperating. Nonexchange transactions generate nonoperating revenues. </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Cont</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>66113</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived DFR - IPEDS, Spring 2013, Finance component</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Frequently used financial indicators for all institutions: Fiscal year 2012</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Frequently used financial indicators for all institutions: Fiscal year 2012</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>DRVF2012</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Maximum</td><td>&nbsp;Minimum</td><td>&nbsp;Mean</td><td>&nbsp;Standard deviation</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;39</td><td>&nbsp;8</td><td>&nbsp;18</td><td>&nbsp;5.77</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>F1PGGCPC - Private gifts, grants, and contracts as a percent of core revenues (GASB)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>Private gifts, grants, and contracts as a percent of core revenues (GASB)

Investment return revenues (F2D10) divided by total core revenues (F2CORREV)

Investment return - Income from assets including dividends, interest earnings, royalties, rent, gains (losses) etc. 
Assets - Physical items (tangible) or rights (intangible) that have value and that are owned by the institution. Assets are useful to the institution because they are a source of future services or because they can be used to secure future benefits 
Interest - The price paid (or received) for the use of money over a period of time. Interest income is one component of investment income. Interest paid by the institution is interest expense. 
Gains - Increases in the institution's net assets from peripheral or incidental transactions. This is in contrast to revenues, which occur from the institution's ongoing major or central operations. Whether a transaction generates revenue or a gain depends on the relationship of the transaction to the institution's activities. For example, the sale of computers by a college store might be part of ongoing central activities, while the sale of surplus computers from administrative offices might be considered otherwise. 
Losses - Decreases in net assets from an organization's peripheral or incidental transactions and other events affecting the organization, other than those that result from expenses </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Cont</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>66217</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived DFR - IPEDS, Spring 2013, Finance component</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Frequently used financial indicators for all institutions: Fiscal year 2012</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Frequently used financial indicators for all institutions: Fiscal year 2012</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>DRVF2012</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Maximum</td><td>&nbsp;Minimum</td><td>&nbsp;Mean</td><td>&nbsp;Standard deviation</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;65</td><td>&nbsp;-67</td><td>&nbsp;-1</td><td>&nbsp;9.02</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>F2OTRVPC - Other revenues as a percent of core revenues (FASB)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>Other core revenues as a percent of total core revenues for public or private-not-for-profit institutions using GASB 34/35 standard is derived as follows:

Government appropriations (revenues)  Revenues received by an institution through acts of a legislative body, except grants and contracts. These funds are for meeting current operating expenses and not for specific projects or programs . The most common example is a state's general appropriation. Appropriations primarily to fund capital assets are classified as capital appropriations.  

Grants and contracts (revenues)  Revenues from governmental agencies and nongovernmental parties that are for specific research projects, other types of programs , or for general institutional operations (if not government appropriations). Examples are research projects, training programs, student financial assistance, and similar activities for which amounts are received or expenses are reimbursable under the terms of a grant or contract, including amounts to cover both direct and indirect expenses. Includes Pell Grants and reimbursement for costs of administering federal financial aid programs. Grants and contracts should be classified to identify the governmental level - federal, state, or local - funding the grant or contract to the institution; grants and contracts from other sources are classified as nongovernmental grants and contracts.

Government grants and contracts (revenues) - Revenues from governmental agencies that are for specific research projects, other types of programs , or for general institutional operations (if not government appropriations). Examples are research projects, training programs, student financial assistance, and similar activities for which amounts are received or expenses are reimbursable under the terms of a grant or contract, including amounts to cover both direct and indirect expenses. Includes Pell Grants and reimbursement for costs of administering federal financial aid programs. Grants and contracts should be classified to identify the governmental level - federal, state, or local - funding the grant or contract to the institution; grants and contracts from other sources are classified as nongovernmental grants and contracts. GASB institutions are required to classify in financial reports such grants and contracts as either operating or nonoperating.  

Operating - GASB requires that revenues and expenses be separated between operating and nonoperating. Operating revenues and expenses result from providing goods and services. Operating transactions are incurred in the course of the operating activities of the institution 

Nonoperating - GASB requires that revenues and expenses be separated between operating and nonoperating. Operating revenues and expenses result from providing goods and services. Nonoperating activities are those outside the activities that are part of the operating activities of the institution. Most government appropriations are nonoperating because they are not generated by the operations of the institution. Investment income is nonoperating in most instances because institutions are not engaged in investing as an operating activity. Gifts are defined as nonoperating. Nonexchange transactions generate nonoperating revenues.

The full-time-equivalent (FTE) enrollment used is the sum of the institutions’ FTE undergraduate enrollment and FTE graduate enrollment (as calculated from or reported on the 12-month Enrollment component) plus the estimated FTE of first-professional students.

Investment return revenues (F2D10) divided by 12-month FTE enrollment (FTE12MN)

Investment return - Income from assets including dividends, interest earnings, royalties, rent, gains (losses) etc. 
Assets - Physical items (tangible) or rights (intangible) that have value and that are owned by the institution. Assets are useful to the institution because they are a source of future services or because they can be used to secure future benefits 
Interest - The price paid (or received) for the use of money over a period of time. Interest income is one component of investment income. Interest paid by the institution is interest expense. 
Gains - Increases in the institution's net assets from peripheral or incidental transactions. This is in contrast to revenues, which occur from the institution's ongoing major or central operations. Whether a transaction generates revenue or a gain depends on the relationship of the transaction to the institution's activities. For example, the sale of computers by a college store might be part of ongoing central activities, while the sale of surplus computers from administrative offices might be considered otherwise. 
Losses - Decreases in net assets from an organization's peripheral or incidental transactions and other events affecting the organization, other than those that result from expenses.

Endowment assets (year end) (F1H02) divided by 12-month FTE enrollment (FTE12MN) 

Endowment assets are gross investments of endowment funds, term endowment funds, and funds functioning as endowment for the institution and any of its foundations and other affiliated organizations. Endowment funds are funds whose principal is nonexpendable (true endowment) and that are intended to be invested to provide earnings for institutional use. Term endowment funds are funds which the donor has stipulated that the principal may be expended after a stated period or on the occurrence of a certain event. Funds functioning as endowment (quasi-endowment funds) are established by the governing board to function like an endowment fund but which may be totally expended at any time at the discretion of the governing board. These funds represent nonmandatory transfers from the current fund rather than a direct addition to the endowment fund, as occurs for the true endowment categories.

The full-time-equivalent (FTE) enrollment used is the sum of the institutions’ FTE undergraduate enrollment and FTE graduate enrollment (as calculated from or reported on the 12-month Enrollment component) plus the estimated FTE of first-professional students. Undergraduate and graduate FTE are estimated using 12-month instructional activity (credit and/or contact hours).

Net assets are the excess of assets over liabilities or the residual interest in the institution's assets remaining after liabilities are deducted. The change in net assets results from revenues, gains, expenses, and losses. FASB institutions classify net assets into three categories: permanently restricted, temporarily restricted, and unrestricted. GASB institutions classify net assets into three categories: invested in capital, net of related debt; restricted (with separate displays of restricted-expendable and restricted-nonexpendable net assets); and unrestricted. Although the terms are similar, the composition of the categories of net assets between FASB and GASB institutions can differ significantly.  

Total assets include current and noncurrent assets

Current assets are assets that are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the next normal operating cycle (normally one year) of the institution. Liquidity or nearness to cash is not the basis for classifying assets as current or non-current; thus cash or investments intended for liquidation of liabilities due beyond the one-year period would not be current assets.

Noncurrent assets are assets that are not reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the next normal operating cycle (normally one year) of the institution. Liquidity or nearness to cash is not the basis for determining classification as current or noncurrent. Thus cash investments intended for liquidation of liabilities due beyond the one-year period are noncurrent assets, as would assets segregated for the liquidation of long-term debts (including amounts due within the next operating cycle). Assets designated to be used to acquire, construct, or improve capital assets would be noncurrent. </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N </td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Cont</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>66187</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived DFR - IPEDS, Spring 2013, Finance component</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Frequently used financial indicators for all institutions: Fiscal year 2012</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Frequently used financial indicators for all institutions: Fiscal year 2012</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>DRVF2012</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>F2EQUITR - Equity ratio (FASB)</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>Equity ratio for public and private-not-for profit institutions using FASB standards is derived as follows:

Total liabilities (F3A02) is subtracted from total assets (F3A01). This amount is then divided by total assets (F3A01)

Liabilities are debts and obligations of the institution owed to outsiders or claims or rights, expressed in monetary terms, of an institution’s creditors. Two types of liabilities are often defined, short-term and long term. Short-term liabilities are those that will be satisfied or paid within one year. Long-term liabilities are those which will not be satisfied within a year. Liabilities include: 1) accounts payable; 2) deferred revenues and refundable advances; 3) Post-retirement and post-employment obligations; 4) other accrued liabilities; 5) annuity and life income obligations and other amounts held for the benefits of others; 6) bonds, notes, and capital leases payable and other long-term debt, including current portions; 7) government grants refundable under student loan programs; and 8) other liabilities (those liabilities not falling in one or more of the above seven categories). The exact categories of liabilities that must be used are not specified and the above are examples only. 

Assets  Physical items (tangible) or rights (intangible) that have value and that are owned by the institution. Assets are useful to the institution because they are a source of future services or because they can be used to secure future benefits.  Assets are usually divided into two categories, current and fixed. Current assets are those that can be readily turned into cash. Fixed assets are those which cannot readily be turned into cash without disrupting the operation of the institution. Fixed assets include intangible assets consisting of certain nonmaterial rights and benefits of an institution, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and goodwill. Categories of assets include the following items: 1) cash, cash equivalents, and temporary investments; 2) receivables (net of allowance for uncollectible accounts); 3) inventories, prepaid expenses, and deferred charges; 4) amounts held by trustees for construction and debt services; 5) long-term investments; 6) plant, property, and equipment; and 7) other assets (those assets not falling in one ore more of the above six categories).

Average net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance.  Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees (lower of in-district or in-state), books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.

The weighted average for room and board and other expenses is generated as follows:

  (amount for on-campus room, board and other expenses * # of students living on-campus.

Average net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance.  Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees (lower of in-district or in-state), books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.

The weighted average for room and board and other expenses is generated as follows:

  (amount for on-campus room, board and other expenses * # of students living on-campus. 
  +  amount for off-campus (with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus with family
  +  amount for off-campus (not with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus not with family)

Applicable to private not-for-profit and for-profit institutions with standard calendar systems (semester, quarter, trimester, 4-1-4) that report financial aid data for students enrolled for the FALL and received aid anytime during the full aid year. These institutions report cost of attendance for the full academic year.

Also, applicable to public or private institutions that measure courses primarily by contact hours, or offers primarily occupational programs measured in credit hours with calendar systems that are continuous, or differs by programs. These institutions report financial aid data for students enrolled between the 12-month period (September 1 through August 31) and received aid anytime during the full aid year. These institutions report cost of attendance for their largest program for the length of that program.

For institutions that report cost of attendance for the full academic year an average yearly net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance.  Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees, books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.

The weighted average for room and board and other expenses is generated as follows:

Students whose living arrangements are unknown are excluded from the calculation.  For some institutions the # of students by living arrangement will be known, but dollar amounts will not be known.  In this case the # of students with no corresponding dollar amount will be excluded from the denominator.

For institutions that report the cost of attendance for their largest program for the length of that program, the cost of attendance is generated as stated above, but is then divided by the number of months to complete the program to produce a monthly cost of attendance. The average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid is also divided by 12 to produce a monthly average. The average net price is generated by subtracting the average monthly grant and scholarship aid from the average monthly cost of attendance and the difference is multiplied by the number of months to complete the program.

Applicable to private not-for-profit and for-profit institutions with standard calendar systems (semester, quarter, trimester, 4-1-4) that report financial aid data for students enrolled for the FALL and received aid anytime during the full aid year. These institutions report cost of attendance for the full academic year.

Also, applicable to public or private institutions that measure courses primarily by contact hours, or offers primarily occupational programs measured in credit hours with calendar systems that are continuous, or differs by programs. These institutions report financial aid data for students enrolled between the 12-month period (September 1 through August 31) and received aid anytime during the full aid year. These institutions report cost of attendance for their largest program for the length of that program.

For institutions that report cost of attendance for the full academic year an average yearly net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance.  Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees, books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.

The weighted average for room and board and other expenses is generated as follows:

  (amount for on-campus room, board and other expenses * # of students living on-campus. 
  +  amount for off-campus (with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus with family
  +  amount for off-campus (not with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus not with family)

divided by the total # of students.

Students whose living arrangements are unknown are excluded from the calculation.  For some institutions the # of students by living arrangement will be known, but dollar amounts will not be known.  In this case the # of students with no corresponding dollar amount will be excluded from the denominator.

For institutions that report the cost of attendance for their largest program for the length of that program, the cost of attendance is generated as stated above, but is then divided by the number of months to complete the program to produce a monthly cost of attendance. The average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid is also divided by 12 to produce a monthly average. The average net price is generated by subtracting the average monthly grant and scholarship aid from the average monthly cost of attendance and the difference is multiplied by the number of months to complete the program.

Applicable to private not-for-profit and for-profit institutions with standard calendar systems (semester, quarter, trimester, 4-1-4) that report financial aid data for students enrolled for the FALL and received aid anytime during the full aid year. These institutions report cost of attendance for the full academic year.

Also, applicable to public or private institutions that measure courses primarily by contact hours, or offers primarily occupational programs measured in credit hours with calendar systems that are continuous, or differs by programs. These institutions report financial aid data for students enrolled between the 12-month period (September 1 through August 31) and received aid anytime during the full aid year. These institutions report cost of attendance for their largest program for the length of that program.

For institutions that report cost of attendance for the full academic year an average yearly net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance.  Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees, books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.

The weighted average for room and board and other expenses is generated as follows:

  (amount for on-campus room, board and other expenses * # of students living on-campus. 
  +  amount for off-campus (with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus with family
  +  amount for off-campus (not with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus not with family)

divided by the total # of students.

Students whose living arrangements are unknown are excluded from the calculation.  For some institutions the # of students by living arrangement will be known, but dollar amounts will not be known.  In this case the # of students with no corresponding dollar amount will be excluded from the denominator.

For institutions that report the cost of attendance for their largest program for the length of that program, the cost of attendance is generated as stated above, but is then divided by the number of months to complete the program to produce a monthly cost of attendance. The average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid is also divided by 12 to produce a monthly average. The average net price is generated by subtracting the average monthly grant and scholarship aid from the average monthly cost of attendance and the difference is multiplied by the number of months to complete the program.

Title IV federal student aid, includes federal grants or federal student loans. 

Applicable to private not-for-profit and for-profit institutions with standard calendar systems (semester, quarter, trimester, 4-1-4) that report financial aid data for students enrolled for the FALL and received aid anytime during the full aid year. These institutions report cost of attendance for the full academic year.

Also, applicable to public or private institutions that measure courses primarily by contact hours, or offers primarily occupational programs measured in credit hours with calendar systems that are continuous, or differs by programs. These institutions report financial aid data for students enrolled between the 12-month period (September 1 through August 31) and received aid anytime during the full aid year. These institutions report cost of attendance for their largest program for the length of that program.

For institutions that report cost of attendance for the full academic year an average yearly net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance.  Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees, books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.

The weighted average for room and board and other expenses is generated as follows:

  (amount for on-campus room, board and other expenses * # of students living on-campus. 
  +  amount for off-campus (with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus with family
  +  amount for off-campus (not with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus not with family)

divided by the total # of students.

Students whose living arrangements are unknown are excluded from the calculation.  For some institutions the # of students by living arrangement will be known, but dollar amounts will not be known.  In this case the # of students with no corresponding dollar amount will be excluded from the denominator.

For institutions that report the cost of attendance for their largest program for the length of that program, the cost of attendance is generated as stated above, but is then divided by the number of months to complete the program to produce a monthly cost of attendance. The average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid is also divided by 12 to produce a monthly average. The average net price is generated by subtracting the average monthly grant and scholarship aid from the average monthly cost of attendance and the difference is multiplied by the number of months to complete the program.
